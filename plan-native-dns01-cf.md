# Plan: Native Cloudflare DNS-01 + DoT docs cleanup

- [x] Fix policy engine availability so UI/API can add rules even with empty config.
- [x] Consolidate DoT/Android documentation and Cloudflare DNS-01 quickstart.
- [x] Run unit/integration tests (`go test ./...`).
- [ ] Merge `feature/native-dns01-cf` into `main`.
- [ ] Tag next release (v0.9.3) after merge.
- [ ] Final DoT/DoH smoke and config directory sync check before release.
